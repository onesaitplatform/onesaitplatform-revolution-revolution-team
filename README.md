## Description 
<p>
Tokenify is a utility aimed at making it easier for Data Scientists to work with datasets that contain sensitive information. <br />
It allows selecting the fields considered sensitive and their subsequent transformation into tokenized values, keeping the rest of the fields unchanged. <br />
In this way it is possible to safely use real data, instead of having to resort to synthetic data or non-representative samples.<br />
</p>
<p>
The objective of the proposal presented aims to provide business functionality both to users belonging to the community already familiar with platform capabilities,<br />
and to external users in order to broaden the platform user base.<br />
It is not intended that the work has the reach of a mere demonstrator without real utility, nor in technical functionalities that do not add value to the end users.<br />
</p>

## How?
We are sure that we have a unique offer in the market based on a combination of differential elements:<br />
<p align="center">   
	Tokenify provides three tokenization methods:<br />
</p><br />
<p>   	
• FPE, format-preserving encryption, which transforms the values ​​through encryption but preserves the original format of the data so that they maintain the properties that allow verifying the suitability of the algorithms.<br />
• AES, symmetric encryption, which also uses encryption but does not preserve the format. This tokenization technique is safer but less convenient.<br />
• Random map, which uses a trivial obfuscation technique. It is the least safe technique but the fastest in computational terms.<br />

## How to build the app and deploy it on server?
<p>
  1 This application front is made with Angular material so you need to have Node.js installed in your computer. <br />
  2 Download this repostory.  <br />
  3 With terminal go where you have this project.<br />
  4 npm install <br />
  5 To run localy: ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json <br />
  6 to generate war: ng build  --base-href ./ --prod (generate the folder dist) and then deploy it on server <br />
